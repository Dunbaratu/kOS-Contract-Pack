This directory is meant to hold the logo images for companies.
Each company needs two logo images, one is 256x160, and the other 64x40.

Naming convention: You should name the logo files like so:

- CompanyName_logo_big.png  (for the 256x160).
- CompanyName_logo_small.png  (for the 64x40).

Any files prepared in some sort of image editor that contains more information
than the output image does (i.e. photoshop or gimp), should be treated as
if those are the "source" files and should be put into the repository as well.
Source for the images should go under /src/logo.
